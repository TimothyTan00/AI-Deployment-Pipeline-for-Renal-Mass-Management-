# AI Deployment Pipeline for Renal Mass Management

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing a software pipeline for deploying AI models, specifically designed for tumor segmentation and classification to assist clinicians in diagnosing Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). It addresses the need for seamless integration of AI-driven solutions in healthcare by providing an end-to-end deployment framework. 

The segmentation model extracts tumor regions from CT images, which are then processed by a classification model to determine whether the tumor is Benign, Malignant-Indolent, or Malignant-Aggressive.

## 🔹 Key Features:
- End-to-End AI Pipeline – Integrates tumor segmentation and classification for precise renal tumor analysis.
- Segmentation Model – Automatically extracts tumor regions from CT images.
- AI Classification Model – Predicts whether the class of tumor using extracted features.
- Web Interface for Clinicians – Upload CT images, receive model predictions, and provide feedback.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Backend: Django REST Framework, FastAPI (for model serving)
- Frontend: React.js or Vue.js (TBD)
- AI Model: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes
- Database (Optional): PostgreSQL (if data storage is needed)

## 📸 UI/UX Features
- Interactive Dashboard: Upload CT images, view AI-generated classifications & confidence scores.
- Clinician Workflow: Simple, intuitive layout for easy navigation & real-time feedback submission.
- Export/Integration: Option to download results or integrate with hospital IT systems.
